# Pig game
# Overview
This project is a simple yet engaging dice game developed in Python. The game allows 2 to 4 players to compete in rolling the dice to achieve a target score. Each player takes turns rolling the dice to accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, their score for that turn becomes zero and the turn ends. The first player to reach or exceed a score of 50 points wins the game.

# Features
Input Validation: Ensures that the number of players is between 2 and 4.
<br />Game Loop: Continues until one player's score reaches or exceeds 50.
<br />Player Turns: Each player decides whether to continue rolling the dice to increase their score at the risk of rolling a 1.
<br />Score Management: Tracks each player's score throughout the game.
